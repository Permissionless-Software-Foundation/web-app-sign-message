# web-app-sign-message

## About (Non-Technical)
This simple web app can be used to sign a message with a WIF private key. A WIF private key starts with the lettter 'K' or 'L'. Fill out the forms below, and you'll be presented with a signed message, proving cryptographically that you own the address associated with that private key.

This app is useful for gaining access to the [PSF VIP Telegram channel](https://t.me/psf_vip). If you store your PSF tokens on a [paper wallet](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafybeifu6fhskdqj3gvp5q3wh3idukhrxiyhrrja6biqrqcei7rj23esn4/), you can use this app to sign the message 'verify' with the WIF from your paper wallet.
